rigwild: Add a new feature to search for products on Amazon

there is 1 parameter which is `searchTerm` which is a string that represents the product to search for, for example `collagen`.

The URL to the product is: https://www.amazon.es/s?k=collagen
With format like https://www.amazon.es/s?k={searchTerm}

When you are navigating to the page, you should scrape the first 15 products from the search results page.

Get the HTML of the following selector: `.s-search-results`
Then, extract each search result using selector `[role="listitem"]`. You will get an array of product elements. Filter out the ads by removing elements that have the class `.AdHolder`.

For each product element, extract the following data:
- The product ID (ASIN) at selector `div[data-component-type="s-search-result"][data-asin]` -> then read the attribute "data-asin" -> then read the attribute "data-asin"
- The product title at selector `h2[aria-label]` then read the attribute "aria-label"
- Is sponsored ad: title starts with `Sponsored Ad – `
- The brand name at selector `h2.a-size-mini span.a-size-base-plus.a-color-base` -> brand name is optional
- The product price
  - Price: `span.a-price[data-a-size="xl"] > span.a-offscreen`
  - Price per unit: `$('span.a-price[data-a-size="b"][data-a-color="secondary"] > span.a-offscreen').parentElement.parentElement.textContent` (optional)
- The product description
  - `#productOverview_feature_div`
  - `#featurebullets_feature_div`
  - `#productFactsDesktop_feature_div`
  - `#brandSnapshot_feature_div`
- The product reviews
  - The average rating at selector `i.a-icon-star-mini span.a-icon-alt`
  - The number of reviews at selector `a[aria-label*="ratings"] span.a-size-small`
- The product images at selector `$("img.s-image").src`
- Is Amazon Prime eligible at selector `$("i.a-icon-prime")`
- Delivery information message (example `'FREE pickup Tomorrow ready by 13:00'`) at selector `$("div.udm-primary-delivery-message").textContent`

tell me how you plan to execute the change, ONLY SAY, then i will tell you if I agree or not.
also suggest any data i could add

GitHub Copilot: Looking at the existing codebase and the requirements for the Amazon product search feature, here's my plan to implement this:

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Feature Analysis
- **Purpose**: Search Amazon products and return structured data for the first 15 results
- **URL Pattern**: `https://www.amazon.es/s?k={searchTerm}`
- **Key Data Points**: ASIN, title, brand, price, reviews, images, Prime eligibility, delivery info
- **Anti-ad filtering**: Remove elements with `.AdHolder` class

### 2. Implementation Strategy

**Core Function in `amazon.ts`:**
```typescript
export async function searchProducts(searchTerm: string): Promise<ProductSearchResult[]>
```

**Return Type Structure:**
```typescript
interface ProductSearchResult {
  asin: string
  title: string
  isSponsored: boolean
  brand?: string
  price?: string
  pricePerUnit?: string
  description?: {
    overview?: string
    features?: string
    facts?: string
    brandSnapshot?: string
  }
  reviews?: {
    averageRating?: string
    reviewCount?: string
  }
  imageUrl?: string
  isPrimeEligible: boolean
  deliveryInfo?: string
}
```

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. Add `searchProducts` function in `amazon.ts` following existing patterns
2. Navigate to search URL with proper error handling
3. Extract `.s-search-results` container HTML
4. Filter `[role="listitem"]` elements, removing `.AdHolder` ads
5. Limit to first 15 non-ad results
6. Create extraction helper function for individual product data
7. Handle edge cases (no results, network errors, login required)
8. Add mock support for testing

### 4. MCP Integration in `index.ts`
- Add new tool `search-products` with zod validation for `searchTerm` parameter
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Return JSON formatted results

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Create `amazon.searchProducts.test.ts` with multiple test cases
- Test with various search terms (common products, special characters, no results)
- Create mock HTML file for consistent testing

## Additional Data Suggestions

Based on the Amazon search results page, I suggest adding:

1. **Product availability status** (In Stock, Out of Stock, Limited availability)
2. **Product URL** for direct linking to product page
3. **Product thumbnail dimensions** (for better image handling)
4. **Discount percentage** if on sale
5. **Product variations count** (size, color options available)
6. **Best seller badge** indicator
7. **Product category/department** information
8. **Estimated delivery date range** (not just pickup info)

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation plan? Any modifications or additional requirements?

rigwild: lets gooooooo

GitHub Copilot: Perfect! Let's implement the Amazon product search feature. I'll start by adding the core functionality to `amazon.ts`. Now let me add the search products function to the amazon.ts file. I'll add it after the getProductDetails section: Perfect! Now I'll add the search products functionality at the end of the file: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now I need to add the new tool to the MCP server in `index.ts`: I need to import the new function and add the tool. Let me first update the import: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me find where to add the new tool by reading the end of the file: Now I'll add the search products tool before the "Start the server" comment: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now let's create a test file for the search products functionality: 

Made changes.

Let me fix the TypeScript error in the test file: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's create a mock HTML file for testing: 

Made changes.

Now let's test our implementation! First, let's build the project to make sure everything compiles correctly: Great! The build was successful. Now let's run our test to see if the search functionality works: I see that the extraction is finding products but not extracting the data properly. This suggests the CSS selectors might need adjustment. Let me examine one of the exported HTML files to see the actual structure: Great! Let me examine the actual HTML structure from the live scraping: I can see the issue now! Looking at the actual HTML structure from Amazon's search results, the structure is very different from what I expected. The page structure uses different class names and the search results are in `s-result-item` elements rather than our expected selectors. Let me update the extraction logic to match the actual Amazon structure: 
```


Made changes.


```
Summarized conversation historyLet's test the updated search functionality! I'll build the project and run the tests to see if our selector fixes are working correctly. Let me check what scripts are available: Let me check the package.json to see what testing framework is being used: I see that there's no test script configured. Let me check how the other test files are run by looking at the existing test files to understand the testing setup: I see, the tests are simple Node.js scripts that can be executed directly. Let me run our test file directly: The test is still returning 0 products even with the updated selectors. Let me check one of the newly exported HTML files to see what the current structure looks like: 

rigwild: stop

GitHub Copilot: Got it! I'll stop the current implementation process. 

The search products feature has been partially implemented with:

1. ✅ Core function structure in `amazon.ts`
2. ✅ MCP tool integration in `index.ts` 
3. ✅ Test file created
4. ✅ Mock HTML file structure
5. ⚠️ CSS selectors need refinement based on actual Amazon HTML structure

The main issue we encountered was that the CSS selectors needed to be adjusted to match Amazon's actual search results page structure. The implementation is in place but would need some selector debugging to extract the product data correctly.

Let me know when you'd like to continue working on this feature or if you'd like to work on something else!
